#####################################################################

## REQUIRED: Store working data, fingerprint, and stats related to your relay.
DataDirectory /var/db/tor	# Default: /var/db/tor

Log notice file /var/log/tor/notice.log
# Log debug  file /var/log/tor/debug.log

## REQUIRED: The relay nickname appearing in Tor's Network.
##	Nicknames must be between 1 and 19 characters inclusive, and must 
##	contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9].
Nickname	torBSD	# Please Change it ;)

## REQUIRED: This line designates that the this node will relay traffic.   
SocksPort	0

## Provide a contact name, and/or email address, and/or PGP key.
ContactInfo	Your Name and/or <your-email@domain.tld> and/or 0xY0URPGPK3YH3R3

## Declare that this Tor server is controlled or administered by a
##	group or organization identical or similar to that of the other
##	servers, defined by their identity fingerprints. When two servers
##	both declare that they are in the same 'family', Tor clients will
##	not use them in the same circuit. (Each server only needs to list
##	the other servers in its family; it doesn’t need to list itself,
##	but it won’t hurt.) Do not list any bridge relay as it would
##	compromise its concealment.
# MyFamily		$FINGERPRINT,$FINGERPRINT2,$FINGERPRINT3,$...

## If you have more than one network interfaces and/or IP addresses available,
##	it's a good idea to bind a specific to this service. Use it more than
##	once if you would like to bind to more addresses, either IPv4 or IPv6.
# OutboundBindAddress	2001:db8:dead:cafe::b5d
# OutboundBindAddress	10.6.6.6

## REQUIRED: TCP port available/advertised for Tor traffic.
##	- Setting it as 'auto' allows the daemon to use a random port and 
##	  stick to it till the next start.
##	- Follow the same behavior decribed by "OutboundBindAddress" 
##	  if you would like to bind different IP addresses for it.
##	- Works with IPv4 and IPv6!
#
#	[NOTE]: If you need to use low ports, or let Tor running behind NAT, you
#		need to setup port forwarding and configure it in your firewall
#		before start getting Tor working and dealing its traffic!
#
#	Example (Advertise port 443, but listen to 9999)
# 	  ORPort	443	NoListen
# 	  ORPort	9999	NoAdvertise
#
#	Example (Behind NAT, and Remote Port Forwarding)
#	  ORPort	203.0.113.234:9001	NoListen	# Public IP
#	  ORPort	10.6.6.6:9999		NoAdvertise	# Private IP
#
#	Example (IPv4+IPv6)
#	  ORPort	203.0.113.234:17500		IPv4Only
#	  ORPort	[2001:db8:dead:cafe::b5d]:17500	IPv6Only
ORPort	9501	# Default: 9001

## TCP port available/advertised for directory servers. Unfortunately, DirPort 
##	works *ONLY* with IPv4.
#
#       [NOTE]: If you need to use low ports, or let Tor running behind NAT, you
#               need to setup port forwarding and configure it in your firewall 
#               before start getting Tor working and dealing its traffic!
#
#       Example (Advertise port 80, but listen to 9980)              
#         DirPort        80     NoListen
#         DirPort        9980   NoAdvertise
#
#       Example (Behind NAT, and Remote Port Forwarding) 
#         ORPort        203.0.113.234:9030      NoListen        # Public IP
#         ORPort        10.6.6.6:9980           NoAdvertise     # Private IP
DirPort	9530	# Default: 9030

## Tells Tor whether to run as an exit relay. If Tor is running as a
##	 non-bridge server, and ExitRelay is set to 1, then Tor allows
##	traffic to exit according to the ExitPolicy option (or the default
##	ExitPolicy if none is specified).
# ExitRelay	0	# Default: auto

## This torrc config do *NOT* allow traffic to go outside of the Tor network 
##	It means that we are *NOT* an Exit Node. Although we do strongly 
##	encourage exploring that option :)
##
## Set an exit policy for this server. Each policy is of the form
##	"accept[6]|reject[6]ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]". If /MASK is omitted then
##	this policy just applies to the host given. Instead of giving a
##	host or network you can also use "*" to denote the universe
##	(0.0.0.0/0 and ::/128), or *4 to denote all IPv4 addresses, and *6
##	to denote all IPv6 addresses.  PORT can be a single port number, an
##	interval of ports "FROM_PORT-TO_PORT", or "*". If PORT is omitted,
##	that means "*".
#
#		*** Please read the tor(1) man page for more details! ***
#
#	Default:
#		reject *:25
#		reject *:119
#		reject *:135-139
#		reject *:445
#		reject *:563
#		reject *:1214
#		reject *:4661-4666

## The Tor relay launches the pluggable transport proxy in
##      path-to-binary using options as its command-line options, and
##      expects to receive proxied client traffic from it.
# ServerTransportPlugin transport exec path-to-binary [options]
# ServerTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/local/bin/obfsproxy --data-dir /var/db/tor --log-file /var/log/tor/obfsproxy.log --log-min-severity info managed

## When this option is set, Tor will suggest IP:PORT as the listening
##	address of any pluggable transport proxy that tries to launch transport.
# ServerTransportListenAddr transport IP:PORT

## When this option is set, Tor will pass the k=v parameters to any
##	pluggable transport proxy that tries to launch transport.
# ServerTransportOptions obfs45 shared-secret=bridgepasswd cache=/var/db/tor/cache

## TCP Port for pluggable transports. Setting to 'auto' means the port
##      will be dynamically assign on Tor startup. If employing a firewall,
##      should set statically to assign pass rule for.
# ExtORPort auto
#####################################################################

## This option configures a threshold above which Tor will assume that it 
##	needs to stop queueing or buffering data because it's about to 
##	run out of memory. If it hits this threshold, it will begin killing 
##	circuits until it has recovered at least 10% of this memory. 
##	Do not set this option too low, or your relay may be unreliable 
##	under (heavy) load.
# MaxMemInQueues	1	GB

## If you want to run a relay in the public network, this needs to be at 
##	the very least 75 KBytes for a relay (that is, 600 kbits) or 
##	50 KBytes for a bridge (400 kbits) — but of course, more is better
##	we recommend at least 250 KBytes (2 mbits) if possible.
# BandwidthRate		768	Kbits	# N bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits

## Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) to
##	the given number of bytes in each direction.
# BandwidthBurst	960	Kbits	# N bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits

## If not 0, a separate token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth 
##	usage for 'relayed traffic' on this node to the specified number 
##	of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to 
##	that same value. 
# RelayBandwidthRate	768	Kbits	# N bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits

## If not 0, limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) 
##	for _relayed traffic_ to the given number of bytes in each direction. 
# RelayBandwidthBurst	960	Kbits	# N bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits

## How many processes to use at once for decrypting onionskins and
##	other parallelizable operations. If this is set to 0, Tor will try
##	to detect how many CPUs you have, defaulting to 1 if it can’t tell.
# NumCPUs 2	# Default: 0
#####################################################################

## Sets the relay to act as a "bridge" with respect to relaying
##	connections from bridge users to the Tor network. It mainly causes
##	Tor to publish a server descriptor to the bridge database, rather
##      than to the public directory authorities.
# BridgeRelay 0

## When set, Tor will fetch descriptors for each bridge listed in the
##	"Bridge" config lines, and use these relays as both entry guards
##      and directory guards.
# UseBridges 0	# Default: 0

## When set along with UseBridges, instructs Tor to use the relay at
##	"IP:ORPort" as a "bridge" relaying into the Tor network. If
##      "fingerprint" is provided (using the same format as for
##      DirAuthority), we will verify that the relay running at that
##      location has the right fingerprint. We also use fingerprint to look
##      up the bridge descriptor at the bridge authority, if it’s provided
##      and if UpdateBridgesFromAuthority is set too.
##
## If "transport" is provided, it must match a ClientTransportPlugin
##	line. We then use that pluggable transport’s proxy to transfer data
##	to the bridge, rather than connecting to the bridge directly. Some
##	transports use a transport-specific method to work out the remote
##	address to connect to. These transports typically ignore the
##	"IP:ORPort" specified in the bridge line.
#
#	Example (Pluggable Transport)
#	  Bridge obfs3 203.0.113.127:9001 BDCADCABDCADABDCABCDBA76431DDBACD123
#
# Bridge IP:ORPort [fingerprint]

## When set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client forwards 
##	its traffic to a SOCKS-speaking proxy on "IP:PORT". It’s the dut
##	of that proxy to properly forward t traffic to the bridge.
#
# ClientTransportPlugin transport socks4|socks5 IP:PORT
#
## In its second form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge
##	line, the Tor client launches the pluggable transport proxy
##	executable in path-to-binary using options as its command-line
##	options, and forwards its traffic to it. It’s the duty of that
##	proxy to properly forward the traffic to the bridge.
